    "It is cheaper",
    "It saves time",
    "There are more choices",
    "It increases efficiency",
    "It provides better customer service"
  ],
  transcript: `A: "I used to be the person who didn’t like shopping online, but ever since I experienced home delivery, I no longer shop in stores. When I shop online, the delivery person brings the package right to my door, even up to my floor, and knocks on my apartment door, so I don’t even need to step outside. I really enjoy this convenience."

B: "Shopping online has helped me save quite a bit of money. After a few months of online shopping, I was able to save enough to buy a new bicycle. But don't get me wrong, I haven't been eating any less or cutting back on the groceries I buy. It's just that online shopping allows me to compare prices and choose the store with the best deal."

C: "I’m a pretty busy person, and I often don’t have enough time because of my hectic work schedule. That’s why I always shop online to save time. This way, I don’t need to go to the store in person, and someone will deliver the items directly to me. Additionally, online shopping is very convenient because, with just a few clicks, I can buy everything I want without having to go from one store to another."

D: "I don't shop online because it's cheaper or because of the fast shipping. I shop online because, when browsing online stores, I have a wide range of choices. For the same item, there are many different types and brands for me to choose from and compare, which allows me to pick the one I like the most."`

  topic: "Topic: Actors (câu này nhiều phiên bản nên cứ chọn MWBB - Mẹ Win bừa bộn)",
  transcript: `W: What do you think about casting actors before casting them?

M: I think it's absolutely necessary and the most important thing because it determines whether the actor is suitable for the role or not.

W: I understand that auditions are important. But if we only rely on a 15 to 20 minute audition, that short period of time cannot really show us the actor's full potential.

M: That's a good point. So I think it's better to let actors perform freestyle, not relying on the script, so that they can improvise, thereby clearly showing their acting skills.

W: But actors often respond best to a good script. And they also need a script provided by the director and directed to act according to the script. Actors can’t always act freely.

M: What do you think about stage actors moving to film acting?

W: I think they are two completely different fields. When I was studying acting in college, stage acting and film acting were two completely separate subjects. They require different skills and qualities from the actor. So, it’s not easy to move from stage acting to film acting and vice versa.

M: That’s right. These are two very different forms of acting and they require different skills from the actor. However, as actors, I think we all need encouragement and support from the audience.

W: I completely agree. Actors need praise and feedback to feel recognized for their efforts and contributions.`,

    transcript: `In the competitive world of business today, many companies struggle to find the most effective way to grow their presence. While some argue that marketing budgets are getting out of control, most experts agree on the fundamental importance of traditional methods. The primary advantage of a well-executed campaign is that it can help reach new customers who might otherwise never hear of the brand. By expanding the target audience, businesses can ensure long-term growth and stability.

However, when it comes to specific strategies like sponsoring major events, companies must be extremely cautious. For example, while sponsoring sports tournaments might seem like a great way to gain visibility, there are significant risks involved. Critics argue that if a brand is linked to an event that experiences a scandal or unethical behavior, it can generate negative publicity for the sport as a whole. Instead of promoting a healthy image, the sponsorship might end up damaging the reputation of both the company and the athletic community involved.`

    transcript: `Today we are exploring the lives of two iconic authors who significantly shaped the literary landscape of the 20th century. Although they belonged to different generations and came from diverse backgrounds, they shared a profound mutual respect that deeply influenced their writing style. One of the most fascinating aspects of their professional relationship is that they both make references to each other in their work, subtly weaving their colleague's ideas, themes, or even names into their own narratives as a form of literary tribute.

However, their writing is certainly not for the casual reader. These authors are famous for their layers of symbolism and philosophical depth. Many literary critics have noted that the meaning of their work is not always easily identified, as it usually requires deep reflection and multiple readings to truly grasp the underlying messages. This inherent complexity is exactly what has kept scholars and fans debating the true intent of their stories for decades.`

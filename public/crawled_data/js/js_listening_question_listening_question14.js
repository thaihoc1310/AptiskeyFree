  topic: "Topic: Protect the environment",                  
  options: [
    "Does not use commercial cleaning products",
    "Give away used items",
    "Buy environmentally friendly products",
    "Reuse containers for storing food",
    "Plant trees in the backyard",
    "Use solar panels for electricity"
  ],
  transcript: `Person A: I find the act of giving away old or secondhand items a bit hypocritical. Why do people give away their old things, only to go out and buy the same item but brand new? Not only does this fail to protect the environment, but it also causes double the harm. Personally, I have a way of protecting the environment by not releasing harmful chemicals into it. I do this by not purchasing chemical cleaning solutions. Instead, I make use of natural products like lemons to create my own floor-cleaning solutions.

Person B: I often don\'t have time to think about how to reuse my belongings or clothes, but I don\'t want to throw them away because that would be wasteful. So, I think a better way is to donate them to charity organizations or give them to others. Many people are in need of these things, and giving away my old items also makes me feel happier because I\'m helping others.

Person C: A good way to protect the environment is by not using plastic bags or by bringing reusable bags when going to the market, which helps reduce the disposal of plastic bags, a material that is difficult to decompose. However, I\'m a very busy person and rarely have time to prepare my own bags when going shopping, and I usually drive to buy groceries quickly instead of walking. I guess I can\'t protect the environment by not driving. But I have a principle of only buying eco-friendly products, so I think I’m still contributing in a small way to protecting the Earth.

Person D: I see that too many people are wasting food containers, as they often throw them away after use, such as glass jars or plastic bottles. I can reuse them to store food and neatly organize them in my refrigerator. Reusing these containers is a very easy way to protect the environment that anyone can do.`

  topic: "Topic: Protect the environment",                  
  options: [
    "Shopping online",
    "Not driving to work",
    "Using less electricity",
    "Using less water",
    "Buying imported goods",
    "Wasting more energy"
  ],
  transcript: `A: I usually shop online to reduce the need to drive to the supermarket, which produces harmful emissions for the environment. Additionally, I can avoid using plastic bags for groceries when shopping in person. By simply sitting at home and clicking a few buttons, I can buy everything I want without emitting harmful gases from a car.

B: I used to drive to work for a long period, but then I realized that the excessive use of personal cars contributes significantly to environmental pollution. Therefore, I chose to ride a bicycle to work, which benefits both the environment and my health.

C: I'm not that into environmental protection and usually just do what’s convenient for me. But my electric bill last month shocked me because it was so expensive, and I realized that I needed to save money. So from now on, I’ll have to manage my electricity use more efficiently.

D: I think a lot of people overemphasize protecting the environment by cutting down on personal vehicles, avoiding plastic bags, planting a lot of trees, and so on. But I personally believe we should focus on protecting the environment through small daily actions we often overlook. For example, turning off the water while brushing our teeth or washing our hands. If everyone saves a little water like that, it would add up to a huge amount saved globally.`

  options: [
    "The products are delivered",
    "It is cheaper",
    "It saves time",
    "There are more choices",
    "It increases efficiency",
    "It provides better customer service"
  ],
  transcript: `A: "I used to be the person who didn’t like shopping online, but ever since I experienced home delivery, I no longer shop in stores. When I shop online, the delivery person brings the package right to my door, even up to my floor, and knocks on my apartment door, so I don’t even need to step outside. I really enjoy this convenience."

B: "Shopping online has helped me save quite a bit of money. After a few months of online shopping, I was able to save enough to buy a new bicycle. But don't get me wrong, I haven't been eating any less or cutting back on the groceries I buy. It's just that online shopping allows me to compare prices and choose the store with the best deal."

C: "I’m a pretty busy person, and I often don’t have enough time because of my hectic work schedule. That’s why I always shop online to save time. This way, I don’t need to go to the store in person, and someone will deliver the items directly to me. Additionally, online shopping is very convenient because, with just a few clicks, I can buy everything I want without having to go from one store to another."

D: "I don't shop online because it's cheaper or because of the fast shipping. I shop online because, when browsing online stores, I have a wide range of choices. For the same item, there are many different types and brands for me to choose from and compare, which allows me to pick the one I like the most."`

But if I listen to music as soon as I wake up, it gives me a headache all day and makes it hard for me to focus on anything. So, I just listen to music to relax when I’m feeling comfortable, not for any other reason.\"\n\nB: \"I usually listen to a pop or rock song as soon as I get out of bed in the morning because it helps me wake up instantly. If I don't listen to music at that moment, I don't know when I'll be able to get up and go to work.\"\n\nC: \"My brothers and friends often say that I have a beautiful voice, so I often sing when I meet them.

Whenever I want to relax or enjoy the scenery, I ride my horse along the farm and across the meadows.\"\n\nB: \"My husband and I often wake up early and go to a nearby forest for exercise. We usually go jogging in the early morning to stay healthy, and we really enjoy the fresh air and natural scenery in the forest.\"\n\nC: \"I used to love mountain biking, enjoying the thrill of riding down steep slopes. It was really an amazing and adventurous feeling. However, after an injury from a fall, I became haunted by the fear of crashing and now I'm scared of this sport. But I still love the mountains, so I’ve decided to just go hiking every weekend instead.\"\n\nD: \"My father often encourages me to ride horses because it’s a sport he enjoys. But I’m very afraid of this animal and never want to learn how to ride, even though there’s a riding school near my house. Instead, I prefer mountain biking with my friends to conquer high peaks.\""

So, I bought a one-year gym membership and go there to exercise every day.\"\n\nB: \"I see many people wake up early to go jogging and exercise to stay healthy. As for me, I usually walk along the beach simply to relax because there’s a beautiful beach near my house. Every morning, I spend time walking on the white sand; it really helps a lot with my mental well-being.\"\n\nC: \"I usually wake up early in the morning to exercise, and I choose to jog on the street because of its convenience. I just need to step out of the house, and I can start exercising. However, I have to go jogging early to avoid cyclists. My friends go to the gym to exercise a lot, but I find something artificial about the whole thing.\"\n\nD: \"Near my house, there’s a stadium where many people go to exercise. I often run on the track there, and it makes me feel like I’m running more professionally. My personality is quite competitive, so I also time myself and race with my friends there.\""

But what I've found is that exercising actually boosts my productivity a lot and really helps me focus better. So, I always try to squeeze in some exercise before heading to work—it definitely makes me more productive.\"\n\nC: \"We’ve all heard about the many benefits of exercising, and I know about them too. My friends often invite me to work out, but after I exercise, I end up feeling extremely exhausted and spend the rest of the day just lying around to recover.\"\n\nD: \"I often go to the gym to work out, but what really motivates me to workout is catching up with my friends there, not just for improving my health.

I save both the time of going to the cinema and a considerable amount of money.\"\n\nB: \"In today's digital age, the internet helps us access social media to stay constantly connected with friends. Especially since I have relatives mainly living abroad or in distant cities, the internet has been a great help for my family to stay in touch. We often video call each other to share daily stories.\"\n\nC: \"The internet is a great resource for research, finding materials, and useful information for studying.

Instead of spending hours trying to figure out how to do our homework, we quickly go online and find the answers.\"\n\nD: \"I see that people often use the internet to watch movies, read newspapers, quickly update the news, and so on. But I usually use the internet to find directions and public transport to my friends' and relatives' houses. I'm a forgetful person, and I often forget the way, even if I've been there a hundred times. So the internet helps me a lot in not getting lost and easily find nearby public transport.\""

  transcript: `Person A: I was quite excited to see the new museum in town, but when I arrived, I found it smaller than I expected. There were only a few rooms open to visitors, and some exhibitions were still being prepared. I walked through the main displays, took a few photos, and left after about thirty minutes. I thought the museum was interesting, but there was not enough to keep me there for a long time.

Person B: I liked the idea of having a new museum in our town, but my visit was a little frustrating. The building was quite large, and the signs were not very clear. I tried to find the history section, but I ended up walking around the same area several times. In the end, I had to ask a staff member for help because I could not find the correct room.

Person C: For me, the best thing about the new museum was the modern technology. Instead of just reading information on the walls, visitors could use touch screens, audio guides, and even virtual reality to learn about the exhibits. This made the visit much more interesting and enjoyable, especially for young people.

Person D: I had a really good time at the new museum, although I could not see everything in one visit. Some parts were very crowded, and I missed one special exhibition because I arrived too late. I think the museum has a lot to offer, so I would definitely like to go back another day and spend more time there.`

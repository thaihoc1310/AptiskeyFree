This can offer the same benefits as getting a new job, without the challenges of starting over somewhere new."

  transcript: "A: \"I don't like studying in very quiet places such as at home or in the library because I get sleepy easily and might even fall asleep while studying. There's a coffee shop near my house, and I often go there to study because the presence of other people makes me feel more motivated. I find that I achieve higher productivity and efficiency in my studies when I'm there.\"\n\nB: \"I notice that most people prefer doing their homework in the classroom, but for me, those chairs are way too hard and leave me sore all day. I prefer sitting under the trees in the park to study—it's cool, and the air is fresh. There's a famous coffee shop across from where I sit, and they serve really good coffee.\"\n\nC: \"The distance from my house to school is 20 km, and it usually takes me an hour to get there. So, when I'm on the train, I use the time to do homework and review the lessons for the day. Some people say that studying like this can be distracting, but I find it very effective for me.\"\n\nD: \"I don't like studying in very crowded places because I can't focus well. I usually sit on the sofa in the living room to study. My parents often travel for work, so my house is very quiet.\""

  topic: "Topic: Community design",
  transcript: "Man: You know, I believe building design can shape people’s behaviors and interactions from the start. When spaces are designed well, people feel comfortable and naturally start connecting.\n\nWoman: Of course, design matters, but there’s no shortcut to building real community connections. Creating community takes time and consistency, even in spaces that encourage interaction.\n\nMan: Really? But I also feel that work communities and social communities aren’t as different as we might think. Both require spaces that help people feel connected and valued, whether it’s at work or in social settings.\n\nWoman: I’m not sure I agree with that. Work communities and social communities serve very different purposes. In a social community, people gather out of personal interest and shared hobbies, but in work communities, people connect because of their job roles. That can affect how close they feel and how they interact with one another.\n\nMan: I see your point, but even in work communities, people still find ways to connect on a personal level. A good work environment encourages friendships that might go beyond work topics.\n\nWoman: That’s a good point. And with technology, people can now connect for both work and social reasons, even if they’re not physically together. But I still think it’s important to build spaces where people can gather in person.\n\nMan: Yes, I agree, but I think technology has really changed how communities form. It makes connecting so much easier, and people don’t always need to meet face-to-face to feel a sense of community.\n\nWoman: I see that, but I don’t think online connections can fully replace in-person gatherings. There’s a different energy when people come together in real spaces—something technology just can’t replicate.\n\nMan: I understand, but I feel that virtual spaces can be just as meaningful. Technology adds a new layer, making it possible for communities to thrive even across distances, and that’s valuable in its own way."

        question: "What is the speaker's view on insomnia in general?",
        options: [
      "People can't always recognize the symptoms of tiredness",
      "Most people with insomnia actually sleep too much",
      "Insomnia is caused only by physical health problems"
        ],
      }
    ],
    transcript: `While many believe that sleeping fewer hours might actually improve deep sleep through exhaustion, or that drinking a cup of coffee can help some individuals relax before bed, these are largely myths. To truly enhance your rest, the secret lies in your sensory environment. Experts agree that shielding your bedroom from any auditory distractions and ensuring total darkness are the most critical factors. By eliminating both sound and light, you allow your brain to enter a restorative state far more effectively.

Regarding sleep disorders, there is a common misunderstanding of how they manifest. Some people think that insomnia is solely a result of physical health issues, or they mistakenly believe that those with the condition actually spend too much time sleeping. In my view, the core issue is often a lack of awareness. Individuals frequently fail to detect the subtle cues of exhaustion their bodies are sending. Because they cannot always identify the signs that they are genuinely fatigued, they continue to push themselves, worsening the cycle of sleeplessness.`

    transcript: "I’ve just completed a new biography about a well-known physicist, and it’s truly impressive. What makes it engaging is the author’s style, which explains complicated ideas in a clear and simple way, allowing even readers without a scientific background to understand it. The book has already become a bestseller. Many specialists think its popularity comes from its similarity to the earlier book about the same scientist, which was also highly successful. If you liked the previous one, you’ll certainly find this new book worth reading."

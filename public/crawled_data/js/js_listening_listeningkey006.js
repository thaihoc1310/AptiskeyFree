These things can make the air dirty, but in the countryside, there’s a bigger issue. Farmers often start fires to clean their fields. They burn old plants and grass. These fires make a lot of smoke that goes into the air. It's sad because the smoke can hurt animals and make people sick. We need to find better ways to clean fields without using fire."

Poor people don’t have the opportunity or time to enjoy art.\n\nM: Actually, art isn’t limited to any one group. If we have an interest, we can access art because it’s all around us.\n\nW: I wish that when I was a child and in school, I had more exposure to the arts. I'm really glad that now, when my child goes to school, they can have more exposure to the arts.\n\nM: Yes, that's great news. I hope that the authorities and the government will invest more in the arts and make them accessible to everyone, especially by adding more art classes in schools so that students can be exposed to art early on.\n\nW: I agree. Children should be introduced to the arts early so they can develop their own sense of beauty sooner.\n\nM: I think with the development of technology, where we just scroll a bit and see art videos and images flooding social media, art is becoming more accessible than ever.\n\nW: Really?

    ],
    transcript: `Welcome back to "Music Legends." Today, we’re discussing the bittersweet announcement from one of the industry's most enduring icons. After a career spanning over forty years, rumors have been swirling about what’s next. While many younger artists are eager to get him back into the studio, and fans have been buzzing about a potential collaboration with today's pop stars, the singer has dismissed these ideas. He recently clarified that he isn't looking for a comeback or a new creative project. Instead, he expressed a deep desire for peace and quiet. Consequently, it is now almost certain that he will probably retire from singing entirely after his final performance next month, as he feels his voice is no longer what it used to be.

Looking back at his long journey, it’s a career of high peaks and low valleys. Although he never reached a point where he regrets choosing his profession—as he still loves music deeply—the overall trajectory of his fame is quite interesting. Many critics argue that he reached his creative peak far too early in his twenties and struggled to innovate afterwards. When we evaluate his influence on the industry today, there’s a common feeling that, despite his natural talent and early hits, he could have been more successful if he had embraced international trends rather than sticking to a very niche style. It’s a classic case of a great artist who had the potential for global stardom but ended up as a local hero instead.`

        question: "What is the advantage of this new guide?",
        options: [
          "It creates a sense of adventure",
          "It includes detailed hotel reviews",
          "It focuses mainly on luxury travel"

          "It is only suitable for a particular generation",
          "It doesn’t cover popular tourist attractions",
          "It is too expensive for most travelers"
        ]
      }
    ],
    transcript: `In recent years, a new type of travel guide has been developed to appeal to modern travelers, especially younger people who are looking for more exciting and meaningful experiences. Unlike traditional guidebooks that mainly provide practical information such as hotel reviews or transportation details, this new guide focuses on inspiring its readers. It presents travel as an adventure, encouraging people to step out of their comfort zones and explore unfamiliar destinations. As a result, one of its main advantages is that it creates a strong sense of adventure, making traveling feel more engaging and personal rather than routine.

Despite these strengths, the guide is not without its drawbacks. One significant limitation is that it is designed with a specific audience in mind. The language, style, and content are tailored mainly to a particular generation, especially younger travelers who prefer exploration over convenience. Because of this, it may not be suitable for everyone. Older travelers or those who prefer detailed planning and practical information might find it less useful. Therefore, while the guide is innovative and inspiring, its appeal is somewhat limited to a specific group of users.`

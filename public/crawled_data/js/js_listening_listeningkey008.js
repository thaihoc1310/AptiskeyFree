    question: "Listen to a weather forecast. Where will the weather be best?",
    options: ["In the west", "In the south", "In the east"],
    correctAnswer: "In the east",
    transcript: "Good evening, everyone! Here’s your weather update for today. Unfortunately, the weather down south isn’t looking too great—strong winds and heavy rain are expected throughout the day, so it might be best to avoid any outdoor plans in that region. On a brighter note, the west will have decent weather with clear skies and mild temperatures, making it a nice option if you’re looking for some fresh air. However, the best weather can be found in the east, where we’re expecting sunny skies and perfect temperatures for any outdoor activities. If you’re planning to travel, I’d highly recommend heading east for the best conditions. Safe travels, and make sure to check local forecasts for any changes!"

  transcript: "A: \"I am a big fan of newly released movies, but the cost of going to the cinema is too high. I'm just a student, so I can't afford to go to the cinema regularly to indulge in my hobby. Therefore, I think the internet is great because it allows me to watch movies for free at home. I save both the time of going to the cinema and a considerable amount of money.\"\n\nB: \"In today's digital age, the internet helps us access social media to stay constantly connected with friends. Especially since I have relatives mainly living abroad or in distant cities, the internet has been a great help for my family to stay in touch. We often video call each other to share daily stories.\"\n\nC: \"The internet is a great resource for research, finding materials, and useful information for studying. My friends and I often go to each other's houses to do homework together. Instead of spending hours trying to figure out how to do our homework, we quickly go online and find the answers.\"\n\nD: \"I see that people often use the internet to watch movies, read newspapers, quickly update the news, and so on. But I usually use the internet to find directions and public transport to my friends' and relatives' houses. I'm a forgetful person, and I often forget the way, even if I've been there a hundred times. So the internet helps me a lot in not getting lost and easily find nearby public transport.\""

  topic: "Topic: University and technology",
  transcript: "M: What course are you taking these days?\n\nW: I'm currently pursuing an online university degree. It's really suitable and convenient because I can study while working. Technology has truly made education much more accessible.\n\nM: That's amazing. I still remember the old days when you had to stand in long lines to borrow a book from the library, which took a lot of time. And by the time it was your turn, the book was often already gone. Now, when we want to read a book, we just type the title online and have it immediately.\n\nW: Exactly, study materials were really scarce back then, unlike now.\n\nM: That’s why I’m thinking, why not make all school classes online? It would save a lot of costs.\n\nW: I think attending school in person is still very necessary because meeting friends and socializing helps us gain more soft skills.\n\nM: Don’t forget that young people do have a reputation for being less social. They often prefer talking on social media rather than meeting in person.\n\nW: Additionally, I think the variety of courses available nowadays is also a good way to improve education.\n\nM: I don't think so. Offering too many diverse courses can make traditional and core subjects seem less important and neglected.\n\nW: We should also consider competition among universities. It’s essential for universities to continuously improve their programs and attract more funding, especially with the current trend of universities seeking financial autonomy.\n\nM: I don’t think we should turn education into a race like competing businesses. If universities need funding, they can report it to the government and educational organizations.",

    topic: "Writer's block",
    questions: [
      {
        id: "16.1",
        question: "What helps writers focus more on writing?",
        options: [
          "Create dedicated periods",
          "Work in noisy environments",
          "Rely entirely on inspiration"
        ]
      },
      {
        id: "16.2",
        question: "What is a common mistake writers make when generating ideas?",
        options: [
          "Refusing to seek the advice of other people",
          "Writing ideas only in digital format",
          "Spending too much time researching grammar rules"
        ],
      }
    ],
    transcript: `Many writers experience periods when they struggle to stay focused or produce new ideas, a situation often referred to as writer’s block. According to the speaker, one effective way to overcome this problem is by creating dedicated periods of time specifically for writing. Instead of waiting for inspiration to appear naturally, writers are encouraged to build a routine and commit to writing at certain times each day. This structured approach helps improve concentration and allows writers to develop discipline, making it easier to stay productive even when motivation is low.

At the same time, when generating ideas, writers sometimes make avoidable mistakes. One common issue is that they refuse to seek the advice of other people. Some prefer to work entirely on their own, believing that feedback might affect their creativity. In reality, discussing ideas with others can provide fresh perspectives and help improve the quality of their work. By ignoring external input, writers may limit their creativity and miss valuable opportunities to develop stronger ideas.`

        id: "17.1", 
        question: "How is professionalism demonstrated at work?",
        options: [
          "Maintain the positive attitude",
          "Always agree with your manager",
          "Avoid giving feedback to colleagues"

        options: [
          "Change its definition",
          "Increase working hours",
          "Reduce opportunities for remote work"
        ]
      }
    ],
    transcript: `Professionalism at work is often shown through the way employees interact with others and handle daily responsibilities. One clear example is maintaining a positive attitude, even in challenging situations. Instead of complaining or creating conflict, a professional person stays calm, respectful, and supportive toward colleagues. This kind of attitude helps build a healthy working environment, improves teamwork, and increases overall productivity. It also shows reliability and emotional control, which are highly valued in any workplace.

At the same time, the public’s view of professionalism is gradually changing. People no longer see it as strictly following traditional rules such as formal dress codes or rigid behavior. Instead, professionalism is now more about adaptability, communication skills, and the ability to work effectively in modern conditions like remote or flexible environments. This shift reflects how workplaces are evolving, and it highlights the importance of redefining professionalism to match current expectations and realities.`

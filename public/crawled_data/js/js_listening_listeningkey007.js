Even if I weren’t busy, I still wouldn’t like to exercise. I feel uncomfortable as soon as I put on workout clothes. I don’t think exercise is something that suits me.\"\n\nB: \"I know that working out every day is good for my health and helps me get in shape. But what I've found is that exercising actually boosts my productivity a lot and really helps me focus better. So, I always try to squeeze in some exercise before heading to work—it definitely makes me more productive.\"\n\nC: \"We’ve all heard about the many benefits of exercising, and I know about them too. My friends often invite me to work out, but after I exercise, I end up feeling extremely exhausted and spend the rest of the day just lying around to recover.\"\n\nD: \"I often go to the gym to work out, but what really motivates me to workout is catching up with my friends there, not just for improving my health. Plus, it’s a great way to meet and make new friends. For me, exercising is just another chance to socialize.\""

  topic: "Topic: The music",
  transcript: "M: Did you hear about the concert last night? A lot of young people attended.\n\nW: Yes, I know about that concert; it was very popular. I don’t understand why so many young people are so eager to attend. They're blindly idolizing young singers, and these idols don’t really teach them anything good.\n\nM: I see it differently. The young singers today are very talented, and they do a lot of charitable work for society. I think young people look up to them and follow their example.\n\nW: Yes, they volunteer a lot, but they do it for the wrong reasons. They only want to boost their own fame.\n\nM: Oh, I think you don't like young singers because you don't enjoy their music, right?\n\nW: Exactly, I only like listening to classical music from previous generations. I think music preferences are very personal and each generation has its own unique taste in music. But music is always a universal language that conveys emotions everyone can understand.\n\nM: I didn’t study music like you, so I don’t really have any ideas about this.\n\nW: You don’t need to study music to understand it. Just think about why you cry during a sad movie scene when the music plays or why you feel energized when you hear a happy song. Isn’t that right?\n\nM: Yes, I think that’s why films always try to include at least one piece of music.",

    topic: "A research into happiness",
    questions: [
      {
        id: "16.1",
        question: "How has this research into happiness been responded to?",
        options: [
          "It has not been accurately reported by the media",
          "It has been completely ignored by the public",
          "It has led to immediate changes in government policy"

        options: [
          "The research is unlikely to find a conclusive answer",
          "The research has already changed public attitudes",
          "The researchers are biased in their approach"
        ],
      }
    ],
    transcript: `Research into happiness has attracted considerable attention, as scientists try to understand what truly contributes to people’s sense of well-being. Although the topic appears frequently in newspapers and online articles, the way it is presented is often misleading. A common problem is that the media does not report the findings accurately. Instead, complex studies are simplified or taken out of context, with headlines focusing on surprising or appealing conclusions rather than the full picture. This can give the public an incomplete or even incorrect understanding of what the research actually shows.

Regarding the overall value of this research, the speaker expresses a cautious opinion. While these studies offer interesting perspectives on human behavior and emotions, it seems unlikely that they will lead to a single, definitive answer. Happiness is a complex concept that varies greatly from person to person and is influenced by many different factors, including culture, lifestyle, and personal expectations. Because of this complexity, the research may continue to evolve, but it is unlikely to produce one clear conclusion that applies universally.`

          "It’s unlikely to appeal to international readers"
        ]
      }
    ],
    transcript: `The new novel has recently received a great deal of attention from readers and critics alike. One of the main reasons it has attracted such interest is the strength of its characters. Rather than relying on complex plots or detailed background information, the story focuses on creating individuals who feel realistic and engaging. Readers are drawn to these characters because of their unique personalities and emotional depth, which makes it easier to connect with the story and remain interested throughout.

As for the overall opinion of the novel, the speaker is quite positive about its potential impact. Although it may not be perfect in every aspect, it is believed that the book will play an important role in increasing the author’s recognition. In fact, the success of this novel is likely to help establish the author's popularity among a wider audience. With strong character development and an engaging narrative style, the book has the potential to become a significant milestone in the writer’s career.`

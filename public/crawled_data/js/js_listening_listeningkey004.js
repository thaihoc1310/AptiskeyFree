  correctAnswer: "the mountain scenes",
  transcript: "\"The Fall\" is one of my favorite films, which I saw last weekend. The film was so terrific that it kept me on the edge of my seat all the time. I usually don’t like watching action movies as they feel the same and repetitive with those dull racing car scenes and meaningless fights that go on for hours. The mountain scenes were rather unusual. The sequencing fascinatingly brings out the most captivating parts for me. The ending, however, was a bit sad. Many people wish it was a happy ending."

  transcript: "A: \"I see a lot of people listen to music right when they wake up to help them feel alert. But if I listen to music as soon as I wake up, it gives me a headache all day and makes it hard for me to focus on anything. So, I just listen to music to relax when I’m feeling comfortable, not for any other reason.\"\n\nB: \"I usually listen to a pop or rock song as soon as I get out of bed in the morning because it helps me wake up instantly. If I don't listen to music at that moment, I don't know when I'll be able to get up and go to work.\"\n\nC: \"My brothers and friends often say that I have a beautiful voice, so I often sing when I meet them. I usually play music on the TV and hold the remote control, pretending it's a microphone so I can sing.\"\n\nD: \"I have a habit of listening to music while studying; it helps me stay motivated and alert while doing my assignments. If I don't play music, I could fall asleep at any moment, and I'll study in a discouraged mood.\""

  topic: "Topic: Information and technology",
  transcript: "M: Hi, what have you been studying lately?\n\nW: Oh, I'm still studying technology and information systems—it's a really hot topic these days.\n\nM: That's a fascinating field. I still can't imagine the future of humanity alongside technology. I think within the next hundred years, humans won't be able to keep up with the pace of information technology development.\n\nW: I believe that the younger generation and future generations will become increasingly smarter, and they'll discover even more amazing things about information technology to benefit society.\n\nM: But if technology advances too quickly and becomes too sophisticated, won't that cause a lot of people to lose their jobs? Many industries could be replaced by machines and robots. In the future, machines might even be smarter than humans.\n\nW: I think machines are just there to support humans in their work; they can't replace us or be smarter than us. If machines and robots are involved in the work process, they will make our jobs less strenuous and improve efficiency. This, in turn, will drive continuous economic and social development alongside technological advancements.\n\nM: What about the issue of personal data breaches? We should have more policies to protect personal information and prevent machines from leaking important personal data.\n\nW: I agree with you. A major issue with information technology is the potential for data breaches. If we can improve this, it would be fantastic."

    topic: "A regional development plan",
    questions: [
      {
        id: "16.1",
        question: "Why do residents oppose this plan?",
        options: [
          "It doesn't do enough to promote alternatives to driving",
          "It increases the number of public parks in the area",
          "It provides free public transportation for all residents"
        ]
      },
      {
        id: "16.2",
        question: "What difficulties is the city council having with this plan?",
        options: [
          "The plan is not making efficient use of existing land",
          "The plan has already exceeded its budget by a large margin",
          "There is too much public support, making it hard to manage expectations"
        ],
      }
    ],
    transcript: `Welcome back to our community forum. We've been receiving a lot of letters regarding the proposed development project in our area. Residents oppose this plan primarily because of its narrow focus; many are disappointed that it doesn't do enough to promote alternatives to driving, such as better cycling lanes or expanded bus routes.

Beyond the public's reaction, the city council is also hitting some major roadblocks. The main difficulty the city council is having with this plan is their realization that it is not making efficient use of existing land. Instead of revitalizing the empty spaces in the city center, the proposal unnecessarily pushes into the outskirts, which many officials believe is a strategic mistake.`

        id: "17.1", 
        question: "What should students do when choosing a career?",
        options: [
          "Be flexible and open minded",

          "Focus only on the salary offered"
        ]

      {
        id: "17.2", 
        question: "What should students pay attention to when applying for jobs these days?",
        options: [
          "They are becoming more competitive",
          "Most jobs no longer require any qualifications",
          "Companies prefer handwritten applications"
        ]
      }
    ],
    transcript: `Transitioning from the structured environment of academic life to the professional world is often one of the most significant shifts a young adult will ever experience. When standing at this crossroads, many graduates feel immense pressure to find the perfect role immediately. However, most career counselors suggest that the best approach for students is to be flexible and open-minded during the initial stages of their journey. Instead of limiting themselves to a narrow path or a specific job title, they should be willing to explore various industries, as their first job is rarely their last, but rather a valuable learning opportunity.

Furthermore, it is vital for graduates to have a realistic understanding of the current economic landscape. When applying for positions in the modern market, students must pay close attention to the fact that jobs are becoming more competitive than ever before. With a global pool of talent and the rise of automation, simply having a degree is often just the baseline requirement. To succeed, applicants need to go beyond their formal qualifications by highlighting their soft skills, unique experiences, and a strong work ethic to distinguish themselves in an increasingly crowded field of candidates.`
